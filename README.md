"# Watch" 

A simple, responsive digital watch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The project displays the current time in real‑time and updates every second, demonstrating core front‑end skills such as DOM manipulation, styling, and dynamic UI updates.

Features
Live digital clock that updates automatically
Clean and minimal UI
Fully responsive layout
Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries)

Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for layout and styling
JavaScript (ES6+) for real‑time functionality

Project Structure
index.html – main layout
styles.css – styling and responsive design
index.js – time logic and DOM updates
images/ – project images - proof of work

How It Works
The JavaScript script retrieves the current system time using the Date() object and updates the UI every second using setInterval(). 
This creates a smooth, real‑time digital clock effect.
